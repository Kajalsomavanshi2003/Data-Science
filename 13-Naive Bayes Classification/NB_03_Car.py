**Business Objective:**
The business objective is to predict whether users in a social network are likely to purchase a luxury SUV recently launched by a car company at a high price. The target variable is "Purchased," where 1 implies a purchase and 0 implies no purchase.

**Constraints:**
No specific constraints are mentioned in the provided information.

### Data Dictionary:

| Feature         | Data Type | Description                               | Relevance to Model |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| User ID         | Integer   | Unique identifier for each user            | Not Relevant       |
| Gender          | Categorical | Gender of the user                       | Relevant           |
| Age             | Integer   | Age of the user                           | Relevant           |
| EstimatedSalary | Integer   | Estimated salary of the user              | Relevant           |
| Purchased       | Binary    | Target variable indicating purchase (1) or not (0) | Target Variable    |

### Data Pre-processing:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Check for missing values (not mentioned in the problem statement).
   - Remove unnecessary columns (User ID).

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - No explicit feature engineering is mentioned. However, transformations may be applied during data preprocessing based on EDA findings.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1. **Summary:**
   - Descriptive statistics of numerical features (Age, EstimatedSalary, Purchased).
   - Distribution of categorical features (Gender).

2. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Distribution plots for Age and EstimatedSalary.
   - Count plot for Gender.
   - Bar plot for Purchased.

3. **Bivariate Analysis:**
   - Scatter plots of Age vs. EstimatedSalary colored by Purchased.
   - Box plots or violin plots of EstimatedSalary for each gender.

### Model Building:

1. **Build the model on scaled data:**
   - Standardize numerical features (Age, EstimatedSalary).
   - Encode categorical features (Gender).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Build a Naïve Bayes Model:**
   - Use Bernoulli Naïve Bayes for binary classification.
   - Train the model on the training set.

3. **Validate the Model:**
   - Predict on the test set.
   - Evaluate the model using a confusion matrix, precision, recall, and accuracy.

4. **Tune the Model:**
   - Depending on the initial performance, tune hyperparameters or try alternative models.

### Benefits/Impact of the Solution:

1. **Improved Targeted Advertising:**
   - The model can help the car company target users more likely to purchase the luxury SUV through personalized advertisements.

2. **Resource Optimization:**
   - Efficient use of advertising resources by focusing on users with a higher likelihood of making a purchase.

3. **Increased Sales:**
   - Higher conversion rates and increased sales due to targeted marketing.

4. **Cost Savings:**
   - Reduced marketing costs by avoiding unnecessary advertisement expenses to users less likely to make a purchase.

5. **Enhanced User Experience:**
   - Users receive relevant ads, leading to an improved overall user experience in the social network.

In conclusion, the model aims to provide a more effective and targeted approach to advertising, ultimately benefiting the car company by maximizing the impact of their marketing efforts and increasing the likelihood of sales for the luxury SUV.
